# Image-Classification
The project aims to create a machine learning model capable of classifying images of hands showing the gestures for "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors." This task is commonly known as the Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, two powerful libraries for building and training deep learning models.
